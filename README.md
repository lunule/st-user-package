## Sublime Text 2 config sync repo

A simple way of backing up/syncing of the __*C:\Users\lunule\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User*__ folder. 
Based on @math2001's smart suggestion at https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/what-s-the-best-way-to-backup-the-st3-configuration/25494#post_2 🙇‍♂️

### How to use it?

Quote @math2001:
